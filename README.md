# Getting Started with indexed.xyz Data

First, you should have a look at the documentation for the [object layout](schema.md) we're using in R2, as well as the schema of the Parquet files.

If you want to get started right away, the quickest way is with the [Goldsky CLI tool](https://docs.goldsky.com/references/cli).

This repo will document additional use cases and provide ways to access and use the data, especially if you want to integrate this data into a data pipeline.

## Downloading the Data

- [Using the AWS CLI](awscli.md)
- [Using rclone](rclone.md)

## Use Cases and Fun Tools

This section is small today, but we'd love you to add any tools you're using or improved ways to access and use the [indexed.xyz](https://indexed.xyz) data!
