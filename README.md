# Getting Started with indexed.xyz Data

First, you should have a look at the documentation for the [object layout](schema.md) we're using in R2, as well as the schema of the Parquet files.

If you want to get started right away, the quickest way is with the [Goldsky CLI tool](https://docs.goldsky.com/references/cli).

This repo will document additional use cases and provide ways to access and use the data, especially if you want to get an idea of what you can do with this data.

## Downloading the Data

- [Using the AWS CLI](awscli.md)
- [Using rclone](rclone.md)

## Use Cases and Fun Tools

This section is small today, but we'd love you to add any tools you're using or improved ways to access and use the [indexed.xyz](https://indexed.xyz) data!

- [Benthos + NeonDB + Hasura](benthos_postgres_hasura.md): A start to finish data processing pipeline in the clouds üå•Ô∏è!
- [Get up and running fast with our friends at Rill](https://rilldata.com/indexed-xyz), a hosted analytics tool based on DuckDB. It's cool.

Have some ideas for more? Start a [discussion](https://github.com/indexed-xyz/docs/discussions), open an issue, a pull request, [let us know via email](mailto:support@goldsky.com), or ping our [Telegram bot](https://t.me/goldskysupportbot), if the bot doesn't get back to you, please ping us on another channel, it's kind of new and may need to be oiled! In general, there's no wrong way to get involved. Ok, there's probably a wrong way, but we'll let you know if that happens üíî.
